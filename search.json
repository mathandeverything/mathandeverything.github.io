Each is all-inclusive, with no prerequisites and supplying everything needed.\nWe want to make your life easier! Use them when you need a class for a substitute or for a fun math club event or however you find them useful. We will continue to add additional modules so check back in whenever you have need for a “class-in-a-box!”"

The materials are designed to work well for either a 40-minute class or a math club activity of an hour or so. Feel free to use the materials in whatever way works best for you.\nIn using the materials, the worksheets should be printed out in advance for use by the students (in groups or individually). The video has two places in it where the instructor is asked to pause the video and have the students work on the worksheets. I think they will enjoy them!\nMath and Urban Planning Video\nMath and Urban Planning Worksheet 1\nMath and Urban Planning Worksheet 2\nProvided by Patti Frazer Lock, St. Lawrence University, plock@stlawu.edu.\nFeel free to share with others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFractals: The Geometry of Nature\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow you will find links to a short (about 20 minutes) video and supporting documents for three activities. The first activity has two documents while the remaining two activities are each one document. The materials are designed to work well for either a 40-minute class or a math club activity of an hour or so. Feel free to use the materials in whatever way works best for you!\nIn using the materials, the worksheets should be printed out in advance for use by the students (in groups or individually). The video has three places in it where the instructor is asked to pause the video and have the students work on the worksheets.\nFor the first activity they will need a straightedge and a way to measure a common distance. I have provided a “ruler” at the bottom of the activity sheet that can be cut out. Alternatively, each student/group could use a standard ruler. They will just want to make sure that their “unit length” matches the lengths at the bottom of the activity sheet.\nFractals - The Geometry of Nature Video\nActivity 1 - Coast Map\nActivity 1 - Worksheet\nActivity 2 - Worksheet\nActivity 3 - Worksheet\nProvided by Dan Look, St. Lawrence University, dlook@stlawu.edu\nFeel free to share with others. I hope they have fun with this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Science and Basketball\n\n\n\n\n\nThe links below provide a classroom activity on an introductory machine learning algorithm called k-nearest-neighbors, applied to a small NBA basketball data set.\nThe structure of the resources is as follows:\n\n(~ 10 minutes). First Video introducing what k-nearest-neighbors is and what classification is.\n(~ 10 minutes). Students should then complete “Part 1” of the attached worksheet. knn_worksheet.pdf\n(~ 7 minutes). Second Video introducing a confusion matrix and a classification rate.\n(~ 10 minutes). Students should then complete the rest of the attached worksheet.\n(~ 3 minutes). Third Video wrapping up some of the concepts discussed.\n\nAdditionally, there is also a solutions file to the questions posed in the worksheet. Students should not need any additional materials to complete the worksheets. I hope you and your students enjoy the activity!\nProvided by Matt Higham, St. Lawrence University, mhigham@stlawu.edu\nFeel free to share with others."
